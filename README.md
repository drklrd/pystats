## Major types of data

- Numerical
	- Quantitative measurement
	- Discreate, Continuos

- Categorical
	- Qualitative data with no inherent mathematical meaning
	- Gender, Yes/no

- Ordinal
	- Mixture of numerical and categorical
	- Rating of a movie

## Mean, Median and Mode

```
Mean : Average

0,2,3,2,1,0,0,2,0

Mean = (0+2+3+2+1+0+0+2+0) / 9 = 1.11

```

```
Sort the values and take the value at midpoint

0,2,3,2,1,0,0,2,0

Sort it :

0,0,0,0,1,2,2,2,3
        *

```

Median is less susceptible to outliers than mean

Eg: Mean houseold income in US is $72,641 but the median is $52,939 as the mean is skewed by some billionaires

Median better represents the typical American in this example


```
	Mode : The most common value in data set
	Not relevant to continuous numerical data
